## Task2
For Task 2, our team member published its interesting research on bitcoin wizards and quantum cats at *BlockBeats*, a very influential media outlet in the Chinese community.

The Chinese version is at the BlockBeats, and the English version can be learned about at Twitter (**besides, @ercwl liked this research**).

In addition to the article, we wrote a little code. You can check in op_cat.cpp.


Based on the BIP draft published on GitHub by Ethan Heilman and Armin Sabouri, https://github.com/EthanHeilman/op_cat_draft/blob/main/cat.mediawikiwe , created a simple pseudocode example to demonstrate how the OP_CAT opcode could be used in a hypothetical Bitcoin script environment. Please note that this is only a conceptual example and the actual implementation may differ. This pseudocode shows how to implement the OP_CAT opcode on a simple stack structure. It pops the top two elements off the stack, concatenates them together, and then pushes the result back onto the stack. The operation fails if there are insufficient elements on the stack or if the size of the concatenated result exceeds the limit.

Remember, in the actual Bitcoin environment, script execution and error handling are more complex, and specific rules of the Bitcoin network must be adhered to. Moreover, the actual Bitcoin script language (Script) is significantly different from conventional programming languages and runs on a specific virtual machine. Ensure a thorough understanding of the relevant technology and specifications before proceeding with any actual development.

We've put all our journey and ideas for designing this video in task3.md, so if it inspires you, give us a STAR!
